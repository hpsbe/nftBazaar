Use polygon mumbai matic tokens for interaction on the website using the polygon-mumbai testnet.

It is a fully-functioning website (I may add features for signing-up and logging-in in the future. 

A fully-functioning NFT marketplace DApp, where the user can ‘list’, ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ NFTs.
The user uploads any item as an NFT first where this item is sent to the Infura IPFS Database. After filling out the details, the connected wallet asks for signature to finally upload/list the item as an NFT.
Once the transaction is uploaded on the blockchain, the user is redirected at the search page where the NFT is called from the before mentioned IPFS database. 
Here the user can buy any listed NFTs uploaded by other users or re-list any of the bought NFTs.
User can check out the description of each NFT listed by clicking on them. Like-wise the user can visit their profile and see the NFTs they have either listed, or bought.

Please note if the rate of the nft you buy on this website is higher than the tokens you own, you wont see a text or error popping up. You can only check that in the console log under errors in inspect elements.

Also it takes a few seconds to redirect to another page once you upload/ list your nft since infura takes a few seconds to access that data.

Have a good experience.
