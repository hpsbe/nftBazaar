Use polygon mumbai matic for interaction on the website using the polygon-mumbai testnet.

It is a fully-functioning website (I may add features for signing-up and logging-in in the future. 

Please note if the rate of the nft you buy on this website is higher than the tokens you own, you wont see a text or error popping up. You can only check that in the console log under errors in inspect elements.

Also it takes a few seconds to redirect to another page once you upload/ list your nft since infura takes a few seconds to access that data.

Have a good experience.
